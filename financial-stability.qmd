## Guaranteeing a sound financial sector

The Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR – Prudential
Supervision and Resolution Authority), which is an administrative
authority attached to the Banque de France, is tasked with the prudential
oversight of banks and insurers and protecting customer interests.

## Anticipating and preventing risks

The Banque de France employs teams of experts and economists to analyse
the workings of the financial sector and identify vulnerabilities. Its
role is to evaluate risks likely to affect the financial markets.
Alongside the ACPR, it assists banks and insurers with their digital
transformation and the fight against climate change, and helps to adapt
regulations to keep the financial system resilient. 

## Ensuring the smooth operation and security of payments

The Banque de France is responsible for overseeing French payment systems
and financial market infrastructures. It ensures the security of cashless
payment instruments and the relevance of the standards applicable in this
area. It also guarantees the smooth operation and security of payment
systems, and the security of financial instrument clearing and settlement
systems.
