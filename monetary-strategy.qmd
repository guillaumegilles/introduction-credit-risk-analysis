ensures that this policy is deployed in France on the Eurosystem’s behalf.

agents.

## Maintaining confidence in the currency in all its forms

circulates effectively and is always of good quality. It ensures it
remains a secure means of payment, accessible to all, in accordance with

payment instruments secure and to encourage innovation. It also makes
sure that central bank money remains an anchor for payment systems.

to keep the Paris financial centre secure and competitive.
